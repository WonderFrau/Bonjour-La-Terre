A place to store things...Honestly I'm still learning what Git and Gitub are :)

Hi, so I am new to computing beyond the basics like browsing the web and word processing. 
A while back my computer died and I was looking for a new comuter and decided to give the raspberry pi a shot.
So I got a pi-top kit and built myself a lap-top and I had so much fun I decided I wanted to learn more about how computers work both at the physical and software levles.
So here I am trying to learn on my own.
I' currently using the Odin Project curriculum as a guide as well as Pi ressources because they have a lot of information.
all this being said, I am very green :)
